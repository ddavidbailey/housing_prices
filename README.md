# Hosing Prices Competition (Kaggle)

[Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course/overview)

## Goals:

The main goal of this project is to test different models and compare their performance against one another. Mainly using some ideas gathered using [Hands on Machine Learning 3rd Ed](https://www.amazon.ca/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B0BHCFNY9Q). The content of this project will mainly pretain to what was covered in the first two chapters, namely regression models. 

I will do my best to follow the main steps as covered at the beginning of ***Chapter Two - End-to-End Machine Learning Project***. These are the steps in order: <ol>
<li>Frame the problem and look at the big picture</li>
<li>Get the data</li>
<li>Explore the data</li>
<li>Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to the machine learning algorithms</li>
<li>Explore different models</li>
<li>Fine-tune models and combine the into a great solution</li>
<li>Present solution</li>
<br/>Optional: <li>Launch, monitor and maintain</li>
</ol>

While the main intention with this project is personally to explore ML Engineering deeper, the focus soley training these models. In the future I may make these models more easily accessible through API endpoints or some other means. Not entirely sure yet
